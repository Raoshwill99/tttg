Built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts, this game offers players a unique opportunity to experience the volatility of Bitcoin markets across different time periods while competing for high scores and achievements.

## Features

7. **Time-Based Events**: Random market events that affect Bitcoin prices and add unpredictability.
8. **Trading Tool Upgrades**: Players can improve their trading capabilities over time.
9. **Dynamic Difficulty**: Game difficulty scales based on player progress.

## Smart Contract Structure

The game is implemented as a Clarity smart contract with the following main components:

- Data Maps: Store player data, Bitcoin prices, quests, achievements, and more.
- Public Functions: Allow players to interact with the game (e.g., time travel, trading, starting quests).
- Read-Only Functions: Provide information about game state, player stats, and Bitcoin prices.
- Private Helper Functions: Handle internal game logic and calculations.
